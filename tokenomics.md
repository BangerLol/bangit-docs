# Tokenomics

#### BANG is a utility token whose value increases with network usage

## Supply

#### Initial Allocation

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Private Sale

* Raised $275k at an equity valuation of $3.5m from [Colosseum](https://www.colosseum.com/) and tasteful angels
* Since Bangit does not generate revenue, all value created by Bangit as demand for its product flows to the BANG token

#### Public Sale (Soon)

* Fixed-price ICO at an initial FDV of $300k
* Offering 60% of the initial supply to raise $180k
* 25% of the raised funds ($45k) will be paired with 15% of the initial supply in a Meteora DAMM v2 pool for $90k of liquidity
* The remaining raised funds ($135k) will go to a futarchy-governed treasury with a $10k allowance per month to the team for operations. Any other withdraws from the treasury must be approved by decision markets. The treasury can be liquidated to holders at any time with a successful proposal.

#### Emissions + Burning

New BANG is minted daily as reward emissions. Reward emissions go to users based on their contributions to the network (open source, governed by futarchy, outlined in [Rewards](rewards.md)). A % of the amount of daily emission rewards are burned by slashing the worst curators' staked BANG balances (open source, governed by futarchy, outlined in Slashing), starting at 100%. BANG's emission rate and mint-burn ratio are governed by futarchy to maximize the price of BANG.

BANG's public sale, treasury, mint authority--and the futarchy markets that govern them--are managed by [Zcombinator](https://www.zcombinator.io/) to enforce the parameters outlined here.
{% endhint %}

## Demand

Staking BANG is required for any meaningful rewards, in-game clout, and influence on the feeds (outlined in Staking). Burns use staked BANG, so BANG must be staked before it can be burned.

#### Rewards

Curators can stake and burn BANG for more voting power to amplify their curator rewards and influence on the feeds. While Bangit is free-to-play, curators must stake and burn a certain amount of BANG (depending on network activity) for any meaningful amount of curator rewards and influence on the feeds. This prevents farming and feed degeneration, requiring burning staked BANG for consequential rewards and influence.
