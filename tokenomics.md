#### Emissions (Rewards)

New BANG is minted daily to reward curators, creators, and inviters based on their contributions to the network (outlined in [Rewards](rewards.md)). BANG's emission rate is governed by decision markets to maximize the price of BANG, starting at a rate of 0.1% of the initial supply per day (36.5% first-year issuance rate).

BANG's public sale, treasury, emission rate, liquidity pool--and the decision markets that govern them--are managed by [Combinator](https://www.combinator.trade/) to enforce the parameters outlined here.

## Demand

#### Why BANG?

Currently, the best curators on Twiter create massive value, but capture none of it. The platform takes the ad revenue. Creators farm engagement. But the people who create signal in a noisy world get nothing.

BANG is tokenized taste. As Bangit usage grows, demand concentrates into buying, staking, and burning more BANG.

#### How Bangit Creates Value

Bangit creates [status, utility, and entertainment](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service) value for content curators, creators, and enjoyers.

**Status**\
Bangit provides a new way for content curators to prove their taste, based on their skill of discovering bangers early. Currently, curators earn local, illiquid status by sharing bangers with friends. But now, with Bangit, curators can earn global, liquid status.

Content creators also earn a new type of status, based on real support for their posts, instead of opaque, outrage-maxxing engagement metrics.

**Utility**\
For casual content enjoyers, Bangit's core utility is a higher-signal content feed, ranked by hard conviction instead of soft engagement. Premium access to this data can help people see what matters faster and easier.

**Entertainment**\
Bangit feels like a game: placing votes, managing power, winning rewards, climbing leaderboards. This competition stokes a desire to progress for more rewarding play.

#### How BANG Captures Value

BANG is how Bangit's value is accessed, competed for, and speculated on. As usage grows, demand concentrates into buying, staking, and burning more BANG.

All the value created by Bangit flows to the BANG token. Bangit does not and will not accrue value to any other instrument (equity, token, or otherwise).

#### Staking: Skin in the Game

Staking is what separates Bangit from the attention economy free-for-all. When you stake BANG, you're betting on yourself, saying: _I have conviction in my taste._

Staking BANG is required to get meaningful value from Bangit. A daily-increasing Time Multiplier compounds this value over time. Exiting is costly: Unstaking BANG burns 1-10% of your BANG and unlocks over 14 days, while benefits drop immediately.

#### Burning: Where Value Goes

Bangit creates persistent demand for BANG via structural burns and optional burns. All burns apply to staked BANG.

**Structural (always on)**\
Built-in sinks that encourage high-quality curation and alignment

* **Slashing:** penalizes low-quality curation
* **Unclaimed rewards decay:** 10% burned every 7 days left unclaimed
* **Unstaking fees:** 1-10% burn to exit, plus time delay
* **Delegation fees:** 10% burn on rewards earned from delegated power

**Optional (on demand)**\
Convert BANG into more status, utility, or entertainment

* **Boosts:** power refills, higher conviction votes
* **AI access:** query an agent trained on the top tweets by conviction
* **Ads:** pin a tweet to the Hot feed
* **Premium Feeds:** subscriptions, notifications (coming soon)
