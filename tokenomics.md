#### Emissions (Rewards)

New BANG is minted daily at a rate of 0.05% of the initial supply per day (18.25% first-year issuance rate). 100% of emissions go to reward curators, creators, and inviters based on their contributions to the network (outlined in [Rewards](rewards.md)). BANG's emission rate is governed by decision markets to maximize the price of BANG.

{% hint style="info" %}
BANG's public sale, treasury, emission rate, liquidity pool--and the decision markets that govern them--are managed by [Combinator](https://www.combinator.trade/) to enforce the parameters outlined here.

## Demand

Bangit creates value through [status, utility, and entertainment](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service). BANG is how that value is priced and competed for. As usage grows, demand concentrates into buying, staking, and burning more BANG.

#### Value

**Status**\
Status (_social capital_) can be converted into money (_financial capital_). Bangit offers a new way to earn status based on how good you are at curating bangers early. Currently, curators can earn local, illiquid status by curating bangers early and sharing them with friends in group chats. Now, curators can earn global, liquid status on Bangit.

**Utility**\
Bangit's core utility is a higher-signal content feed, ranked by hard conviction instead of soft engagement. Premium access to these feeds can help people enjoy less slop and more bangers.

**Entertainment**\
Bangit feels like a game: placing votes, managing power, and _winning_ rewards. This competition stokes a desire to _level up_ for more engaging gameplay.

#### Staking

Staking BANG is required to get meaningful value from Bangit (outlined in [Staking](staking.md)). Primarily, staking grants more rewards, clout, and influence on the feeds. A daily-increasing Multiplier compounds these benefits over time. Exiting is intentionally costly: Unstaking BANG burns 1-10% (lower with longer staking) and unlocks over 14 days, while benefits drop immediately.

#### Burning

Bangit creates persistent demand for BANG via structural burns and optional burns. All burns apply to staked BANG.

{% hint style="info" %}
In [Multicoin's framework](https://multicoin.capital/2018/02/13/new-models-utility-tokens/), BANG is a work-style utility token. Contributors stake to earn the right to do work (curate tweets) and earn rewards, while poor performance is penalized.

**Structural (always-on)**\

* **Unclaimed rewards decay:** 10% burned every 7 days unclaimed
* **Unstaking fees:** 1-10% burn to exit with time delay
* **Delegation fees:** 10% burn on rewards earned from delegated power

**Optional (a-la-carte)**\
Convert BANG into status, utility, or entertainment on-demand

* **Ads:** pin a tweet (coming soon)
