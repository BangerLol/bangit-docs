#### Emissions (Rewards)

New BANG is minted daily at a rate of 0.05% of the initial supply per day (18.25% first-year issuance rate). 100% of emissions go to reward curators, creators, and inviters based on their contributions to the network (outlined in [Rewards](rewards.md)). BANG's emission rate is governed by decision markets to maximize the price of BANG.

BANG's public sale, treasury, emission rate, liquidity pool--and the decision markets that govern them--are managed by [Combinator](https://www.combinator.trade/) to enforce the parameters outlined here.

## Demand

As a social network, Bangit creates value in 3 ways: [status, utility, and entertainment](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service). BANG is how that value gets priced, competed for, and captured. As Bangit grows (stronger identities, danker feeds, funner gameplay), demand concentrates into buying, staking, and burning more BANG.

#### Value

**Status**

Status (or _social capital_) leads to opportunity and power. Bangit offers a new way to earn status based on how good you are at curating bangers early. Currently, people can earn local status by curating bangers early and sharing them with their friends in group chats. Now, Bangit gives these curators a way to earn global status (and financial rewards).

**Utility**

Bangit's core utility is a higher-signal content feed, ranked by staked conviction instead of soft engagement. Premium access to these feeds can help people enjoy less slop and more bangers.

**Entertainment**

Bangit feels like a game: placing votes, managing power, and "winning" rewards. This competition stokes a desire to "level up" for more engaging gameplay.

#### Staking

Staking BANG is required for meaningful rewards, status, and influence on the feeds (outlined in [Staking](staking.md)). Unstaking BANG incurs a 1-10% burn fee, which decreases with more time staked. Unstaking BANG decreases benefits immediately, while the unstaked tokens unlock gradually over 14 days.

#### Burning

Bangit creates persistent demand for BANG via structural burns (always on) and optional burns (a-la-carte upgrades). All burns apply to staked BANG.

{% hint style="info" %}
In [Multicoin's framework](https://multicoin.capital/2018/02/13/new-models-utility-tokens/), BANG is a work-style utility token. Contributors stake to earn the right to do work (curate tweets) and earn rewards, while poor performance is penalized.
{% endhint %}

**Structural**

Built-in sinks that encourage high-quality curation and aligned usage

* **Slashing** to penalize low-quality curation
* **Unclaimed rewards decay** to reduce idle extraction and recycle value to active contributors
* **Unstaking fees** so quitting costs
* **Delegation fees** so passive exposure contributes to sinks

**Optional**

A-la-carte purchases that convert BANG into status, utility, or entertainment on-demand

* Boosts (power refills, higher conviction, etc)
* Premium Feeds (subscriptions, notifications, etc)
* Ads (pin a tweet)
