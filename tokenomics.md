## Supply

#### Initial Supply

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Public Sale (60%)**

* 50% of Public Sale's tokens are staked immediately
* 50% of Public Sale's tokens are unlocked when sale completes
* Raising $240k with a fixed-price ICO at an FDV of $400k
* 25% of the raise ($60k) is paired with 15% of the initial supply for $120k of liquidity
* 75% of the raise  ($180k) goes to a treasury governed by decision markets. A $15k allowance per month goes to the team for operations (12 months of runway). Any other withdraws from the treasury must be approved by decision markets. The treasury can be liquidated to holders at any time with a successful proposal.

**Liquidity (15%)**

* 100% of Liquidity's tokens are paired with $45k of raised funds in a Meteora DAMM v2 liquidity pool
* Liquidity pool is owned by the treasury governed by decision markets
* Liquidity pool is locked unless a portion is being used for decision markets

**Team (10%)**

* 100% of Team's tokens are unlocked linearly monthly over 5 years
* Every 5% increment of Team's tokens (0.5% of initial supply) unlocks every $1B FDV (up to $20B FDV) if not yet unlocked
* 50% of Team's tokens are staked

**Private Sale (10%)**

* 100% of Private Sale's tokens are unlocked linearly monthly over 5 years
* Every 5% increment of Private Sale's tokens (0.5% of initial supply) unlocks every $1B FDV (up to $20B FDV) if not yet unlocked
* 50% of Team's share is staked
* Raised $275k at an equity valuation of $3.5m from [Colosseum](https://www.colosseum.com/) and based angels
* 100% of the value created by Bangit (utility/status/entertainment) accrues to the BANG token as demand to buy/stake/burn BANG

**Early Users (5%)**

* Most of these tokens are staked
* Effective airdrop to early users that have contributed to the network as we iterate the product

#### Emissions

New BANG is minted daily at a rate of 0.1% of the initial supply per day (36.5% first-year issuance rate). 100% of emissions go to reward curators, creators, and inviters based on their contributions to the network (algo open source, governed by decision markets, outlined in [Rewards](rewards.md)). BANG's emission rate is governed by decision markets to maximize the price of BANG.

#### Burns

Existing BANG is burned daily. 1-10% of the worst half of curators' staked BANG balances are slashed and burned (algo open source, governed by futarchy, outlined in [Slashing](slashing.md)).

{% hint style="info" %}
BANG's public sale, treasury, emission rate, liquidity pool--and the decision markets that govern them--are managed by [Combinator](https://www.combinator.trade/) to enforce the parameters outlined here.
{% endhint %}

## Demand

Staking BANG is required for any meaningful rewards, in-game clout, and influence on the feeds (outlined in Staking). Burns use staked BANG, so BANG must be staked before it can be burned.

#### Rewards

Curators can stake and burn BANG for more voting power to amplify their curator rewards and influence on the feeds. While Bangit is free-to-play, curators must stake and burn a certain amount of BANG (depending on network activity) for any meaningful amount of curator rewards and influence on the feeds. This prevents farming and feed degeneration, requiring burning staked BANG for consequential rewards and influence.
