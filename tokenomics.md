## Supply

#### Initial Supply

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Public Sale (60% of supply)**

* Raising $120k with a fixed-price ICO at an FDV of $200K
* 50% of Public Sale's tokens are staked immediately upon purchase
* 50% of Public Sale's tokens are unlocked when sale completes
* 75% of raised funds ($90k) goes to a treasury governed by decision markets. A $10k allowance per month goes to the team for operations. Any other treasury transactions must be approved by decision markets.
* 25% of raised funds ($30k) is paired with 15% of the initial supply for $60k of initial liquidity
* Full refund if minimum is not reached

**Liquidity (15% of supply)**

* Paired with raised funds in a Meteora DAMM v2 liquidity pool
* Locked unless a portion is being used for decision markets

**Team (10% of supply)**

* Unlocked linearly over 5 years
* Staked as they unlock with 20% effective earning power

**Private Sale (10%)**

* Unlocked linearly over 5 years
* Staked as they unlock with 20% effective earning power
* Raised from [Colosseum](https://www.colosseum.com/) and angels

**Early Users (5%)**

* Most of these tokens are staked
* Effective airdrop to early users that contributed to the network as we iterated the product

#### Emissions

To bootstrap the network, new BANG is minted daily to the rewards pool, 100% of which goes to top curators, creators, and inviters. Emissions start at 100K BANG (0.1% of the initial supply) on the first day and decrease by 100 BANG everyday, until emissions reach a constant 1K BANG per day.

{% hint style="info" %}
BANG's public sale, treasury, emission rate, liquidity pool--and the decision markets that govern them--are managed by [Combinator](https://www.combinator.trade/) to enforce the parameters outlined here.

## Demand

Bangit creates value through utility, status, and entertainment. BANG is how that value is priced and competed for. Every core action in the protocol either locks or burns BANG.

{% hint style="info" %}
All value captured by Bangit flows to the BANG token. Bangit does not and will not accrue value to any other instrument (equity, token, or otherwise).
{% endhint %}

#### Why BANG?

Currently, the best curators on Twiter create massive value, but capture none of it. The platform takes the ad revenue. Creators farm engagement. But the people who create signal in a noisy world get nothing.

BANG is tokenized taste. As Bangit usage grows, demand concentrates into buying, staking, and burning more BANG.

#### Staking

Staking BANG is required to get meaningful value from Bangit. A daily-increasing Time Multiplier compounds this value over time. Exiting is costly: Unstaking BANG burns 1-10% of your BANG and unlocks over 14 days, while benefits drop immediately.

#### Burning

Bangit creates persistent demand for BANG via structural burns and optional burns. All burns apply to staked BANG. Unlike revenue + buyback loops, all Bangit fees are paid in BANG.

**Security Burns**\
Built-in sinks that encourage high-quality curation and alignment

* **Slashing:** penalizes low-quality curation
* **Unclaimed rewards decay:** 10% burned every 7 days left unclaimed
* **Unstaking fees:** 1-10% burn to exit, plus time delay
* **Delegation fees:** 10% burn on rewards earned from delegated power

**Utility Burns**\
Convert BANG into more status, utility, or entertainment on-demand

* **Boosts:** higher conviction votes, power refills
* **Ads:** pin a tweet to the Hot feed
* **AI access:** query an agent trained on the top tweets (coming soon)

{% hint style="info" %}
In [Multicoin's framework](https://multicoin.capital/2018/02/13/new-models-utility-tokens/), BANG is a work-style utility token. Contributors stake to earn the right to do work (curate tweets) and earn rewards, while poor performance is penalized.
