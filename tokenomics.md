### Emissions

To bootstrap the network, new BANG is minted daily to the Rewards Pool, 100% of which goes to top curators, creators, and inviters. Emissions start at 100K BANG (0.1% of the initial supply) on the first day and decrease by 100 BANG everyday, until emissions reach a constant 10K BANG per day.

BANG's public sale, treasury, emissions, liquidity pool--and the decision markets that govern them--are managed by [Combinator](https://www.combinator.trade/) to enforce the parameters outlined here.

## Demand

Bangit creates value through utility, status, and entertainment. BANG is how that value is priced and competed for. Every core action in the protocol either locks or burns BANG.

{% hint style="info" %}
All value captured by Bangit flows to the official BANG token. Bangit does/will not accrue value to any other instrument (equity, token, or otherwise).
{% endhint %}

### Why BANG?

Currently, the best curators create massive value, but capture none of it. The platform takes ad revenue. Creators farm engagement. But the people who create signal in a noisy world get nothing.

BANG is tokenized taste. It's a utility token grants access to more rewards, clout, and influence for higher-signal content feeds. As Bangit usage grows, demand concentrates into buying, staking, and burning more BANG.

### Staking

Staking BANG is required to get meaningful value from Bangit. A daily-increasing Time Multiplier compounds this value over time.

Unstaking BANG incurs a 1-10% fee and unlocks over 14 days, while benefits drop immediately.

### Fees

Bangit creates persistent demand for BANG via fees. Unlike revenue + buyback loops, fees are paid directly in staked BANG. For all BANG fees: 50% is burned, 40% goes to the Rewards Pool, and 10% goes to the Lottery Pool. The Rewards Pool (from fees and emissions) is distributed every 24 hours at midnight UTC to top curators, creators, and inviters. At the same time, the Lottery Pool has a 7% chance of being distributed to top curators.

#### Voting

Currently, voting with >10% of Max Power requires spending some staked BANG. Above 10% conviction, every 1% of Max Power invests 0.1% of your staked BANG. Post-TGE, this buffer will be removed so that every vote incurs a fee.

#### Pinning

#### Slashing

Bangit uses analysis tools to detect and slash cartels. If you move as a pack, you will be slashed.

#### Unclaimed Rewards

10% fee on unclaimed rewards every 7 days left unclaimed.

#### Unstaking

1-10% fee to unstake, which decreases with more time staked.

#### Delegation

10% fee on rewards earned from delegated power.
