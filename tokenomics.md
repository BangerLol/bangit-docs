## Supply

#### Initial Supply

**Public Sale (60% of supply)**

* Raising $150k with a fixed-price ICO at an FDV of $250K
* 50% of Public Sale's tokens are staked immediately upon purchase
* 50% of Public Sale's tokens are unlocked when sale completes
* 75% of the raise  ($112.5k) goes to a treasury governed by decision markets. A $10k allowance per month goes to the team for operations. Any other treasury transactions must be approved by decision markets.
* 25% of the raise ($37.5k) is paired with 15% of the initial supply for $75k of initial liquidity

**Liquidity (15% of supply)**

* Paired with raised funds in a Meteora DAMM v2 liquidity pool
* Locked unless a portion is being used for decision markets

**Team (10% of supply)**

* Unlock linearly over 5 years
* Staked as they unlock with 20% effective earning power

**Private Sale (10%)**

* Unlock linearly over 2.5 years
* Staked as they unlock with 20% effective earning power
* Raised from [Colosseum](https://www.colosseum.com/) and angels

**Early Users (5%)**

* Most of these tokens are staked
* Effective airdrop to early users that contributed to the network as we iterated the product

#### Emissions (Rewards)

New BANG is minted daily to reward curators, creators, and inviters based on their contributions to the network (outlined in [Rewards](rewards.md)). BANG's emission rate is governed by decision markets to maximize the price of BANG, starting at a rate of 0.1% of the initial supply per day (36.5% first-year issuance rate).

BANG's public sale, treasury, emission rate, liquidity pool--and the decision markets that govern them--are managed by [Combinator](https://www.combinator.trade/) to enforce the parameters outlined here.

## Demand

Bangit creates value through [status, utility, and entertainment](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service). BANG is how that value is priced and competed for. As usage grows, demand concentrates into buying, staking, and burning more BANG.

#### Value

**Status**\
Bangit offers a new way to earn status based on how good you are at curating bangers early. Currently, curators can earn local, illiquid status by curating bangers early and sharing them with friends in group chats. With Bangit, curators can earn global, liquid status.

**Utility**\
Bangit's core utility is a higher-signal content feed, ranked by hard conviction instead of soft engagement. Premium access to these feeds can help people see what matters.

**Entertainment**\
Bangit feels like a game: placing votes, managing power, and winning rewards. This competition stokes a desire to level up for more engaging gameplay.

#### Staking

Staking BANG is required to get meaningful value from Bangit. A daily-increasing Multiplier compounds this value over time. Exiting is intentionally costly: Unstaking BANG burns 1-10% (lower with longer staking) and unlocks over 14 days, while benefits drop immediately.

#### Burning

Bangit creates persistent demand for BANG via structural burns and optional burns. All burns apply to staked BANG.

{% hint style="info" %}
In [Multicoin's framework](https://multicoin.capital/2018/02/13/new-models-utility-tokens/), BANG is a work-style utility token. Contributors stake to earn the right to do work (curate tweets) and earn rewards, while poor performance is penalized.
{% endhint %}

**Structural (always-on)**\
Built-in sinks that encourage high-quality curation and aligned usage

* **Slashing:** penalizes low-quality curation
* **Unclaimed rewards decay:** 10% burned every 7 days unclaimed
* **Unstaking fees:** 1-10% burn to exit with time delay
* **Delegation fees:** 10% burn on rewards earned from delegated power

**Optional (a-la-carte)**\
Convert BANG into more status, utility, or entertainment on-demand

* **Boosts:** power refills, higher conviction votes
* **Ads:** pin a tweet
* **Premium Feeds:** subscriptions, notifications (coming soon)
