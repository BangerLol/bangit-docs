# Mission

## **Twitter is broken**

Banger tweets drown in slop, clickbait, and paid shills. The algo incentivizes engagement farming. And the people who find bangers early get nothing.

## **What if engagement had skin in the game**

Curators earn for upvoting top tweets with accuracy, speed, and conviction. Creators earn when their tweets get upvoted. Tweets sorted by conviction instead of likes.
