## Bangit: gamified curation markets for Twitter/X

**For Curators,** voting feels like sharing bangers with friends. But you're also earning rewards, climbing leaderboards, and building reputation for your taste.

**Creators** rewards and glory too. But for posting bangers, instead of engagement farming.

**For Enjoyers,** the interface feels like a social media feed. But posts are ranked by conviction, instead of engagement metrics.
