# Mission

## **Twitter is broken**

Banger tweets drown in slop, clickbait, and paid shills. The algo incentivizes engagement farming. And the people who find bangers early get nothing.

## **What if engagement had skin in the game**

Curators vote on tweets with a limited, re-generating resource. Curators earn Taste scores and token rewards for upvoting top tweets with speed and conviction. Tweets are sorted by stronger signals based on popularity and conviction.

## What we're building.
