# Vision

**Twitter is broken.** Bangers drown in slop, clickbait, and paid shills. While engagement farmers get rich. And the heroes who do find bangers early get nothing. **Bangit fixes this.**

### What We're Not Building

* :x: **Another social app ->** :white\_check\_mark: Value layer for existing content
* :x: **Another InfoFi app ->** :white\_check\_mark: Beyond engagement metrics
* :x: **Another launchpad ->** :white\_check\_mark: New collaborative game
* :x: **Twitter competitor ->** :white\_check\_mark: Twitter's missing incentives
* :x: **Extractive tokenomics ->** :white\_check\_mark: Heavy community ownership



We don't just consume content. We curate culture. And get paid for our taste.
