# Mission

## **Twitter is broken**

Banger tweets drown in slop, clickbait, and paid shills. The algo incentivizes engagement farming. And the people who find bangers early get nothing.

## **What if engagement had skin in the game**

If it was costly to boost slop, and rewarding to boost bangers, then tweets could be sorted by conviction instead of soft engagement metrics. While real curators and creators get paid.
