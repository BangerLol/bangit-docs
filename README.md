# Overview

## The Curator Economy

#### A gamified taste market for Twitter/X

Bangit is a game for voting on tweets. The best tweets rise to the top, while the best curators and creators earn rewards.

The interface feels like a social media feed—but posts are ranked by hard conviction, instead of soft engagement. The gameplay feels like sharing tweets with friends—but players compete for glory and financial rewards, instead of local clout. Content creators earn rewards too—but for posting bangers, instead of engagement farming.
