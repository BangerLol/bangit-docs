# Overview

## The Curator Economy

Bangit is a game for upvoting and downvoting tweets, where the best tweets rise to the top while the best curators and creators earn rewards. Bangit's interface feels like a social media feed, but posts are ranked by skin-in-the-game conviction, instead of soft engagement. Bangit's gameplay feels like sharing tweets with friends, but curators compete for glory and financial rewards, instead of local clout. Content creators earn rewards too, but for posting bangers, instead of engagement farming.
