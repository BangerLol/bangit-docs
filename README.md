# Mission

## **Twitter is broken**

Banger tweets drown in slop, clickbait, and paid shills. The algo incentivizes engagement farming. And the people who find bangers early get nothing.

## **What if engagement had skin in the game**

Curators earn tokens for upvoting top tweets with speed and conviction. Creators earn tokens when their tweets get upvoted. Sort tweets by conviction, instead of likes.

## What we're building.
