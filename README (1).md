# Mission

## **Social media sucks**

Bangers drown in slop, clickbait, and ads. Engagement farming is systemically rewarded. People who do find bangers early get nothing except maybe some local clout in group chats.

## Because there's no skin in the game

The root cause of social media's problems: Engagement has no skin in the game. There's no cost for engaging with slop, and no rewards for engaging with bangers. So selfish interests boost slop, and tastemakers don't boost bangers.

## **What if engagement had skin in the game?**

If it was costly to boost slop, and rewarding to boost bangers, then people would exercise taste when engaging with posts. Then, posts could be sorted by real conviction instead of soft engagement metrics. While the best curators and creators share in the value of the platform.
