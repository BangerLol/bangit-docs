# Manifesto

## **We are what we eat**

The thoughts, feelings, and actions around us influence our own.\
"You are the average of the people you spend the most time with."\
\
But now we spend more time online than anywhere else.\
So we're becoming the average of the content we consume.\
\
Curation = nutrition.\
Curators are the cultural nutritionists of the internet age.\
They find good content early, deliver it to the right people, and keep group chats healthy.

## Food groups

**Bangers make us stronger.**\
Useful ideas to apply, uplifting stories to feel, beautiful art to enjoy.\
OMG, LOL, WOW.\
Laughing, learning, and capitalizing on opportunities.

**Slop makes us weaker.**\
Rage bait, fear bait, ads.\
MEH, WUT, EW.\
Wasting our time, polluting our psyche, and selling us stuff we don't need.

## Fast food

We get most of our content from social media feeds. A few private companies control the feeds. So these companies are controlling the lives of billions of people to varying degrees.\
\
But the default feed shows mostly slop.\
Slop is the default because: slop is cheaper to produce, slop sells more, and weak metrics.\
\
1\) Slop is cheaper to produce than bangers\
Brandolini's Law: "The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it."\
\
2\) Slop sells more\
The feed tells us what to fear.\
The ads sell us the cure.\
\
3\) Weak metrics\
A algorithmic feed is only as good as the metrics used to score posts.\
And today's metrics are based on simple engagement:\
\- a hate-click counts the same as a love-click\
\- doomscrolling counts the same as delight\
\- sheer volume beats niche conviction\
So shiny slop gets the same reach as true bangers.\
\
Slop is proliferating and becoming harder to avoid.

### They're feeding us slop

Slop is becoming harder to avoid. The feeds tell us what to fear. The ads sell us the cure. Engagement farming is systemically rewarded. People who do find bangers early get nothing except maybe some local clout in group chats.

### Because there's no skin in the game

The root cause of the sloppening: Engagement has no skin in the game. There's no cost for engaging with slop, so selfish interests boost slop. And there's no reward for engaging with bangers early, so tastemakers don't boost bangers.

Even if social media companies wanted to show us bangers only, it's impossible, because engagement metrics are noisy signal without skin in the game.

### **What if engagement had skin in the game?**

If it was costly to boost slop, and rewarding to boost bangers, then people would exercise more taste when engaging with posts. Then, posts could be sorted by real conviction instead of soft engagement metrics. While the best curators and creators share in the value created by the platform.

### It's all curation, always has been
