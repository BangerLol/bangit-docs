# Mission

## **Social media is broken**

Bangers drown in slop, clickbait, and ads. The algo incentivizes engagement farming. People who find bangers early get nothing except maybe some local clout.

## **What if engagement had skin in the game?**

If it was costly to boost slop, and rewarding to boost bangers, then people would exercise taste when engaging with posts. Then, posts could be sorted by real conviction instead of soft engagement metrics. While the best curators and creators get rewarded.
