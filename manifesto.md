# ⭐ Manifesto

## The daily dose

Open Twitter. WTF _scroll_ DUMB _scroll_ CHILL _scroll..._ **Bang**_**.**_ Wow. This is great. I just evolved. _**30 minutes later.**_ Why am i still scrolling? What just happened?

## They promised us bangers

Every day we open social media expecting to see what matters. But it mostly shows what makes us keep scrolling and clicking.

We're accepting a deal from social media platforms, which sounds pretty good: Show us what gets the most engagement, because that's what people want. And sure, show us some ads, as long as it's free to use.

This is the attention economy.

And sometimes it works. That's why we keep coming back. **For the bangers.**

Discovering alpha before everyone else. Sharing something that makes our friends laugh. Enjoying a post that feels like it was written TO you.

But the bangers are buried under endless slop. **Rage/fear/lust-bait. Brainrot. Misinformation.**

## Nobody wants this

The most disturbing part about the sloppening is that nobody wants this.

Users don't want slop. Creators don't want to make slop. Platforms don't want to serve slop. And yet, slop proliferates. Why?

## Why slop wins

Platforms optimize for engagement (scrolls, clicks, time-spent) because more engagement = more ad revenue. But engagement metrics can't tell the difference between "engaged because I love this" vs. "engaged because this sucks". **A hate-click counts the same as a love-click.**

So simple content that provokes strong emotional reactions (especially negative ones) wins. Slop is also cheaper to produce. So emotional slop floods the feed. And as people engage, it spreads.

Platforms _could_ optimize for satisfaction or long-term retention, instead of session length. Some have tried. But those metrics conflict with short-term engagement, which drives ad revenue.

So it's a race to the bottom. Not because anyone chose it. But because competition, dopaminergic biology, and Schelling Points make it inevitable. From a gods-eye view, every platform should optimize for quality. From within the system, no individual can afford to.

Our attention is the raw material getting processed and sold to advertisers. Slop is just the most efficient way to extract it.

## The root cause

Compare the Twitter feed to a group chat.

In a group chat, if you share slop, you get ignored or mocked. If you share a banger, you're celebrated. You actually risk part of your clout every time you share something, with a chance to earn more. There's social skin in the game.

But on Twitter, there's no cost for rage-clicking slop, and no reward for supporting a banger early. Accounts just scroll and click. And the algorithm aggregates it.

This is the root cause of the sloppening:

**Engagement has no skin in the game.**

Without stakes, platforms rank content by _engagement_ (how many interactions) instead of _conviction_ (how strongly people with skin in the game actually support it). Activity is all they measure, so activity is all that matters.

## We are what we scroll

"You are the average of the people you spend the most time with."

But now we spend more time online than anywhere else. So we're becoming the average of the content we consume.

Bangers make us stronger: useful ideas, uplifting stories, beautiful art, jokes that hit. Slop drains our spirit. But the algorithm can’t tell the difference, because it's tuned for reactivity, not quality. And everyday it runs, the feed drifts further downward.

## Why we're here

We're power users. Curators. We spend hours finding signal in the noise. Delivering it to the homies.

In college, I wrote a crypto newsletter. The most popular section, by far, was "Tweets of the Week": the best tweets I'd found while scrolling Crypto Twitter. People said it was the only reason they subscribed. Because they could enjoy a highlight reel of bangers. Skipping the slop.

But I couldn't figure out how to make it sustainable. Ads meant selling my readers' attention. Subscriptions meant charging for free content I simply organized better. Neither felt right.

That's when I realized: **Curation is valuable, but there's no economic model for it.** People who find bangers early get nothing. The platform that serves slop gets everything.

## Proof of Taste

What if the people who find bangers early actually got rewarded? What if taste was an asset, instead of just a hobby?

That's Bangit. A gamified curation market for Crypto Twitter.

How it works: Upvote bangers. Downvote slop. Your staked BANG tokens determines your voting power. If others agree, you earn. If they don't, you lose.

Creators earn automatically too when their tweets get upvoted.

Bangit provides new rules for social media, so that individual incentives (rewards) align with positive collective outcomes (higher-signal content feeds). Bangers rise because people commit to them. Slop sinks because it's expensive to pretend it's good.

And all the value captured flows to the people who make social media worth opening: the best curators and creators.

## The world if social media had skin in the game

We believe taste, the ability to recognize quality, is one of the most undervalued skills in the world.

Until now, it's been a passion project. Something we do for clout in group chats. While slop merchants get rich farming people's attention.

Taste should be an asset.

Millions of people around the world are already playing this game everyday. Finding bangers early and sharing them with friends. But, the gameplay is local, fragmented, and unrewarding.

Bangit makes the game of content curation global, unified, and worth playing. While producing a content feed ranked by what people stand on. Instead what they clicked or lingered on.

Welcome to the homepage of social media. Where taste finally pays.
