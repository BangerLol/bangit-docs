# Manifesto

## They’re feeding us slop

Every day we open a social media feed expecting to see _what matters_. But it only shows _what spreads_. It’s not evil. It’s just incentives: engagement is cheap, so it gets gamed.

## We are what we scroll

"You are the average of the people you spend the most time with." But now we spend more time online than anywhere else. So we're becoming the average of the content we consume. Bangers make us stronger: useful ideas to apply, uplifting stories to feel, beautiful art and jokes to enjoy. Slop makes us weaker: rage/fear bait, lukewarm opinions, sneaky ads.

But algorithms can’t tell the difference, because the signal is noisy.

## Root cause of the sloppening

Engagement has no skin in the game. There's no cost for engaging with slop, so selfish interests boost slop. And there's no reward for engaging with bangers, so curators don't boost bangers. Platforms prioritize posts by activity (instead of quality), because it’s what they can measure.

Feeds within group chats are better because they have status-based skin in the game. If you share slop, you're ignored. If you share bangers, you're celebrated.

## Bangit legitimizes taste

Bangit is a new game for upvoting and downvoting tweets. Voters are rewarded and/or slashed based on their predictive accuracy of the impact of tweets. Content creators earn rewards too, automatically for highly upvoted tweets.

The result: Bangers rise because people commit to them. Slop sinks because it’s expensive to pretend it’s good. And the best curators and creators share in the value created.

## What we’ve learned

We tried a “tweetcoin” launchpad to test conviction-based feeds.

The vision resonated with people (1k+ users), but the experience wasn’t delightful enough: too much friction (pay-to-play), too much complexity (portfolio management), and too PvP (whale manipulation).

So we built a better game. Bangit is free-to-play, simple, and more PvE. A gamified prediction market built for Crypto Twitter and beyond. With 1 token where all value flows.

## The Homepage of Social Media

Millions of people are playing the game of finding bangers early and sharing them with friends. But, the gameplay is local, fragmented, and lacks real upside. Bangit is a global, unified, rewarding version of this game, where the best tweets rise to the top.
