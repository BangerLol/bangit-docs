# Manifesto

## The daily dose

Open Twitter/X. WTF _scroll_ DUMB _scroll_ EW _scroll..._ **BANG**_**.**_ Wow. I'm definitely gonna use that. I just evolved. _**30 minutes later.**_ Why am i still scrolling? What just happened? Screw this, i got stuff to do.

## They promised us bangers

Every day we open social media expecting to see _what matters_. But it mostly shows _what makes us keep scrolling and clicking_.

Social media made a simple promise: show us what gets the most engagement, because that's what the people want. Attention-based democracy. And sometimes it works. So we keep coming back. For the thrill of discovering alpha before everyone else. The satisfaction of sharing something that makes your friends laugh. The warmth of a post that feels written just for you in that moment.&#x20;

But the bangers are buried under endless slop. Rage/fear/lust-bait. Brainrot. Misinformation.

## Why slop wins

Platforms optimize for engagement (scrolls, clicks, time-spent). Because more engagement = more ad revenue.

But here's the problem: engagement metrics can't tell the difference between "engaged because I love this" vs. "engaged because this was so dumb it made me mad". **A hate-click counts the same as a love-click.**

So content that provokes strong emotional reactions (especially negative) wins. Slop is also cheaper to produce. So emotional slop floods the feed. And as people engage, it spreads. A brutal downward spiral.

Platforms _could_ optimize for satisfaction or long-term retention instead of session length. Some have tried. But those metrics conflict with short-term engagement, which drives ad revenue. So why would they?

In the attention economy, our attention is the raw material getting processed and sold to advertisers. Slop is just the most efficient way to extract it.

## The root cause

Compare a Twitter feed to a group chat.

In a group chat, if you share slop, you get ignored or mocked. If you share bangers, you're celebrated. Your reputation is on the line every time you hit send. There's social skin in the game.

But on Twitter, there's no cost for rage-clicking slop and no reward for supporting a banger early. The algorithm just sees a click. Engagement is cheap.

This is the root cause of the sloppening:

**Engagement has no skin in the game.**

Without stakes, platforms rank content by _activity_ (how many interactions) instead of _conviction_ (how strongly people actually endorse it). Activity is all they measure, so activity is all that matters.

## We are what we scroll

"You are the average of the people you spend the most time with."

But now we spend more time online than anywhere else. So we're becoming the average of the content we consume.

Bangers make us stronger: useful ideas, uplifting stories, beautiful art, jokes that hit. Slop drains our spirit. But algorithms can’t tell the difference, because they're tuned for stickiness, not quality.

## Why we're here

We're Twitter power users. Curators. We spend hours finding signal in the noise. Delivering it to people who trust our taste.

In college, I wrote a crypto newsletter. The most popular section, by far, was "Tweets of the Week": a curation of the best tweets I'd found while scrolling Crypto Twitter. People said it was the only reason they subscribed.

It made sense. Readers were collectively saving hundreds of hours. Getting the bangers without the slop.

But I couldn't figure out how to make it sustainable. Ads meant selling my readers' attention. Subscriptions meant charging for content I'd simply organized better. Neither felt right.

That's when I understood: **Curation creates real value, but there's no economic model for it.** The people who find bangers early get nothing. The platform that serves the slop gets everything.

## Proof of Taste

What if the people who find bangers early actually got rewarded? What if taste was an asset, instead of just a hobby?

That's Bangit.

Here's how it works: when you see a tweet you believe in, you vote on it. The amount of tokens you've staked determines your voting power. If others agree, you earn. If they don't, you lose. Creators earn automatically too, when their tweets get upvoted.

The result: a feed ranked by conviction, not activity. Bangers rise because people commit to them. Slop sinks because it's expensive to pretend it's good. And the value flows to the people who actually make social media worth opening: the best curators and creators.

## The world if social media had skin in the game

We believe taste, the ability to recognize quality, is one of the most undervalued skills in the world.

For too long, it's been a hobby. Something you do for clout in your group chats while slop merchants farm engagement and get rich off people's attention.

We think taste should be an asset.

Bangit is where the best curators and creators capture the value they create. Where your feed is ranked by what people stand on, not just what they clicked on.

Millions of people are already playing this game everyday. Finding bangers early and sharing them with friends. But, the gameplay is local, fragmented, and unrewarding.

Bangit makes content curation global, unified, and worth playing.

Welcome to the homepage of social media. Where taste finally pays.
