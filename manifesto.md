## The daily dose

Open Twitter. WTF _scroll_ DUMBAF _scroll_ YOCHILL _scroll..._ **Bang**_**.**_**&#x20;Wow. This is great. I just evolved.** _30 minutes later._ Why am i still scrolling? What just happened?

## They promised us bangers

Every day we open social media expecting to see what matters. But it mostly shows what makes us keep scrolling and clicking.

This is the attention economy.

And sometimes it works. That's why we keep coming back. For the bangers.

Discovering alpha before everyone else. Sharing something that makes our friends laugh. Enjoying a post that feels like it was written TO you.

But the bangers are buried under endless slop: rage/fear/lust-bait, brainrot, misinformation.

Nobody wants this.

Users don't want  to see slop. Creators don't want to make slop. Platforms don't want to serve slop. Yet, slop is everywhere. Why?

## Why slop wins

Spicy shallow content triggers more dopamine than calm deep content. So users click and linger more on spicy shallow content. Not because they're bad. But because incentives.

Platforms optimize for clicks and lingers. Because engagement is easy to measure and monetize via ads. Not because they're bad. But because incentives.

Creators optimize for clicks and lingers. Because that's what gets them the most reach and creator payouts. Not because they're bad. But because incentives.

So spicy shallow content proliferates. And slop is cheaper to produce than bangers. So emotional slop floods the feed. And as people engage, it spreads.

But a rage/fear/lust-click counts the same as a love-click.

Platforms _could_ optimize for satisfaction or long-term retention, instead of clicks and lingers. Some have tried. But those metrics conflict with short-term engagement, which drives ad revenue.

So it's a race to the bottom. Not because anyone chose it. But because dopaminergic biology, competition, and Schelling Points make it inevitable. From a gods-eye view: users, platforms, and creators should optimize for truth. From within the system, it feels like no individual can afford to.

Our attention is the raw material getting processed and sold to advertisers. Slop is just the most efficient way to extract it.

## The root cause

Compare the Twitter feed to a group chat.

In a group chat, if you share slop, you get ignored or mocked. If you share a banger, you're celebrated. You actually risk part of your clout every time you share something, with a chance to earn more. There's social skin in the game.

But on Twitter, there's no cost for rage-clicking slop, and no reward for supporting a banger early. Users just scroll and click. And the algorithm aggregates it.

This is the root cause of the sloppening:

**Engagement has no skin in the game.**

Without stakes, platforms rank content by _engagement_ (how many interactions) instead of _conviction_ (how strongly people with skin in the game actually support it). Activity is all they measure, so activity is all that matters.

## We are what we scroll

"You are the average of the people you spend the most time with."

But now we spend more time online than anywhere else. So we're becoming the average of the content we consume.

Bangers make us stronger: useful ideas, uplifting stories, beautiful art, jokes that hit. Slop drains our spirit but keeps us on the hook. But the algorithm can’t tell the difference, because it's tuned for addictivity, not quality.

## Why I'm here

I'm a power user. Curator. Spending hours finding signal in the noise. Delivering it to the homies.

In college, I wrote a crypto newsletter. The most popular section, by far, was "Tweets of the Week": the best tweets I'd found while scrolling Crypto Twitter. People said it was the only reason they subscribed. To enjoy a highlight reel of bangers.

But I couldn't figure out how to make it sustainable. Ads meant selling my readers' attention. Subscriptions meant charging for free content I organized better. Neither felt right.

**Curation is valuable, but there's no economic model for it.** People who find bangers early get nothing. The slop merchants get everything.

That ain't right!

What if the people who find bangers early actually got rewarded? What if taste was an asset, instead of just a hobby?

## Proof of Taste

Bangit provides new rules for social media, so that individual incentives align with better content feeds (and higher token value). Bangers rise because people commit to them. Slop sinks because it's expensive to pretend it's good.

And all the value captured flows to the people who make social media worth opening: the best curators and creators.

## The world on Bangit

Millions of people around the world are already playing this game everyday: Finding bangers early and sharing them with friends. But the gameplay is local, fragmented, and unrewarding.

Bangit makes content curation global, unified, and worth playing. While creating feeds where tweets are ranked by what people stand on. Instead of what they clicked or lingered on.
