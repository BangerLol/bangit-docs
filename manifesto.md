# Manifesto

## The daily dose

Open Twitter/X. WTF _scroll_ DUMB _scroll_ EW _scroll..._ **BANG**_**.**_ Wow. I'm definitely gonna use that. I just evolved. _**30 minutes later.**_ Why am i still scrolling? What just happened? Screw this, i got stuff to do.

## They promised us bangers

Every day we open social media expecting to see _what matters_. But it mostly shows _what makes us keep scrolling and clicking_.

Social media made a simple promise: show us what gets the most engagement, because that's what the people want. Attention-based democracy. And sometimes it works. So we keep coming back. For the thrill of discovering alpha before everyone else. The satisfaction of sharing something that makes your friends laugh. The warmth of a post that feels written just for you in that moment.&#x20;

But the bangers are buried under endless slop. Rage/fear/lust-bait. Brainrot. Misinformation.

Because platforms optimize for engagement (scrolls, clicks, time-spent). Because more engagement = more ad revenue. But engagement metrics can't tell the difference between "engaged because I love this" vs. "engaged because this was so dumb it made me mad". A hate-click counts the same as a love-click.

So content that provokes strong emotional reactions (especially negative) wins. Slop is also cheaper to produce. So emotional slop floods the feed. And as people engage, it proliferates. A brutal downward spiral.

Platforms _could_ optimize for satisfaction, regret signals, or long-term retention instead of session length. Some have experimented with this. But these metrics conflict with short-term engagement numbers, which drives ad revenue. So why would they?

In the attention economy, our attention is the raw material getting processed and sold to advertisers. Slop is just the most efficient way to keep us on the hook.

## Root cause of the sloppening

Compare the Twitter feed to a group chat.

In a group chat, if you share slop, you're ignored or mocked. If you share bangers, you're celebrated. Your reputation is on the line every time you hit send. There's status-based skin in the game.

But on Twitter, there's no cost for rage-clicking slop and no reward for supporting a banger early. The algorithm just sees a click. Engagement is cheap.

This is the root cause of the sloppening:

**Engagement has no skin in the game.**

Without stakes, platforms are forced to rank content by _activity_ (how many interactions) instead of _conviction_ (how much people actually support it). Activity is all they measure, so activity is all that matters.

## We are what we scroll

"You are the average of the people you spend the most time with."

But now we spend more time online than anywhere else. So we're becoming the average of the content we consume.

Bangers make us stronger: useful ideas to apply, uplifting stories to feel, beautiful art and jokes to enjoy. Slop drains our spirit. But algorithms can’t tell the difference, because the weights are tuned to stickiness, not quality.

## Why we're here

We're Twitter power users. Curators. We spend hours finding signal in the noise. Delivering it to people who trust our taste.

In college, I wrote a crypto newsletter for our college blockchain club. 250+ readers, 40%+ open rate. Every week I'd spend hours scrolling Crypto Twitter, curating the best tweets into a section called "Tweets of the Week".

It was the most popular part by far. People said it was the only reason they subscribed. Which makes sense. Readers were collectively saving hundreds of hours. Getting the bangers without the slop.

But it felt impossible to monetize without ads or subscriptions. Sell my readers' attention, or charge them for free content I'd simply organized better. Neither made sense.

That's when I understood. Curation is valuable, but there's no economic model for it. The people who find bangers early get nothing. The platform that serves the slop gets everything.

That sucks. So we're building something about it.

First, we launched a “tweetcoin” launchpad to test the rawest form of social media [curation markets](https://medium.com/@simondlr/introducing-curation-markets-trade-popularity-of-memes-information-with-code-70bf6fed9881). The vision resonated (1k+ users, $3m+ volume, Colosseum accelerator), but the product wasn’t delightful enough: too complex, too easy to manipulate, and too PvP.

So we built a better game. Simpler. Harder to manipulate. More PVE. With one token where all value flows.

## Proof of Taste

What if the people who find bangers early actually got rewarded? What if taste was an asset, instead of just a hobby?

Bangit turns content curation into a real game with real stakes. Bet on bangers, and win as they rise. Push slop, and you pay. Creators earn too when their posts gets upvoted.

The result: a feed ranked by conviction, not activity. Bangers rise because people commit to them. Slop sinks because it's expensive to pretend it's good. And the value captured flows to the best curators and creators—the people who make social media worth opening.

## The world if engagement had skin in the game

We believe taste, the ability to recognize quality, is one of the most undervalued skills in the world.

For too long, it's been a hobby. Something you do for local clout while slop merchants farm engagement and get rich.

We think taste should be an asset.

Bangit is the game where the best curators and creators capture the value they create. Where your feed is ranked by what people stand on, not just what they clicked on.

Everyday, millions of people are playing the game of finding bangers early and sharing them with friends. But, the gameplay is local, fragmented, and unrewarding.

Bangit is a global, unified, rewarding version of the most popular game in the world.

The homepage of social media. Where taste finally pays.
