# Manifesto

## You are being harvested

Every day we open social media expecting to see _what matters_. But it only shows _what spreads_. Rage/fear/lust bait. Brainrot. Misinformation.

They're mining us. In the attention economy, your focus is the raw material getting processed and sold to advertisers. Slop is just the most efficient way to keep us on the hook.

## We are what we scroll

"You are the average of the people you spend the most time with." But now we spend more time online than anywhere else. So we're becoming the average of the content we consume.

Bangers make us stronger: useful ideas to apply, uplifting stories to feel, beautiful art and jokes to enjoy... Slop drains our spirit.

But algorithms can’t tell the difference, because the signal is noisy. So even if they wanted to show us bangers only (and lose ad revenue based on mass addiction), they couldn't.

So maybe it's evil. But it's also bad game design. The way traditional social media platforms measure attention (engagement) is easy to manipulate. So no matter how good the algorithm is, slop proliferates.

## Root cause of the sloppening

There are many interconnected reasons why traditional social media platforms show so much slop on their main feeds. Slop is cheap to produce, verification is expensive, negative emotionally charged content spreads faster, weak penalties for abusers.

But the root cause of the sloppening: **Engagement has no skin in the game.**

There's no cost for engaging with slop, so selfish interests boost slop. And there's no reward for engaging with bangers, so curators don't boost bangers. With these skewed incentives, platforms are forced to prioritize posts by activity (instead of conviction), because it’s what they can measure.

Feeds within group chats are better because they have status-based skin in the game. If you share slop, you're ignored. If you share bangers, you're celebrated. And you should be. When you share a tweet with someone, you're delivering value, so they don't have to dig around in the slop for it.

## Earn for your taste

Bangit is a new game for upvoting and downvoting tweets. Where content curators can earn rewards, clout, and influence for their taste. Content creators earn rewards too, automatically, when their tweets get upvoted.

The result: Bangers rise because people commit to them. Slop sinks because it’s expensive to pretend it’s good. While the value captured flows to the best curators and creators.

## What we’ve learned

First, we tried a “tweetcoin” launchpad to test social media curation markets in their rawest form.

The vision resonated (1k+ users, Colosseum accelerator), but the product wasn’t delightful enough: too complex, too PvP, and too vulnerable to manipulation.

So we built a better game. Simpler, more PvE, and more resistant to manipulation. Bangit is a gamified curation market for Crypto Twitter and beyond. With 1 token where all value flows.

## The Homepage of Social Media

Millions of people are playing the game of finding bangers early and sharing them with friends. But, the gameplay is local, fragmented, and lacks real upside. Bangit is a global, unified, rewarding version of this game, where the best tweets rise to the top.
