# Manifesto

## **We are what we eat**

The thoughts, feelings, and actions that we observe influence our own. "You are the average of the people you spend the most time with." But now we spend more time online than anywhere else. So we're becoming the average of the content we consume.

## Food groups

**Bangers make us stronger.** Useful ideas to apply, uplifting stories to feel, beautiful art to enjoy. OMG, LOL, WOW. Learning, laughing, and capitalizing on opportunities.

**Slop makes us weaker.** Rage bait, fear bait, ads. MEH, WUT, EW. Wasting our time, polluting our psyche, and selling us stuff we don't need.

## Why fast food dominates

We get most of our content from social media feeds. But these feeds serve mostly slop. Slop is default because it's cheap, urgent, and easy to optimize for engagement. \
\
**1) Slop is cheap to produce**\
Brandolini's Law states "The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than that needed to produce it." With AI tools, the cost of producing mediocre content is collapsing. But producing a banger requires expertise, creativity, and time.\
\
**2) Slop triggers urgency**\
Slop sells because it activates our alarm system. Rage-bait and fear-bait put us in survival mode, triggering compulsive behavior. The feed tells us what to fear. The ads sell us the cure. Bangers are meaningful, but they rarely trigger _must-react-now_ or _must-keep-scrolling_ impulses.\
\
**3) Engagement-based metrics don't measure value**\
An algorithmic feed is only as good as the metrics it's trained on. And today's metrics measure engagement, not impact:\
\- a hate-click counts the same as a love-click\
\- doomscrolling counts the same as delight\
\- volume beats depth\
So shiny slop gets the same reach as real bangers, since engagement metrics measure activity instead of value.

## Root cause

The root cause of the sloppening: **Engagement has no skin in the game.**\
\
There's no cost for engaging with slop, so selfish interests boost slop. And there's no reward for engaging with bangers early, so curators don't boost bangers.\
\
Even if social media companies wanted to show us bangers only, it's impossible with soft engagement metrics, because they're noisy signals without skin in the game.\
\
Feeds within group chats are better because they feature status-based skin in the game. If you share slop, you're ignored. If you share bangers, you're celebrated.\
\
If it was costly to boost slop, and rewarding to boost bangers, then posts could be sorted by impact/value instead of engagement/activity. While the best curators and creators share in the value created by the platform.

## Curation = Nutrition

We've never consumed culture raw. We've trusted elders, teachers, editors, DJs, and critics to curate the best content to help us live better.\
\
Social media didn't kill curation. It just stopped paying for it.\
\
Modern-day curators are already doing the work: finding bangers early, contextualizing them, and delivering them to friends in group chats. But they're getting nothing in return, except maybe some local clout.\
\
Bangit is how we change that. A new way to stake taste, earn for conviction, and purify the feed.
