# Manifesto

## The daily dose

Open Twitter/X. WTF \*scroll\* DUMB \*scroll\* EW \*scroll\* _**BANG.**_ Wow, great point. I'm definitely gonna use that. I just evolved. _**30 minutes later.**_ Why am i still scrolling? What just happened? Screw this, i got stuff to do.

## They promised bangers

Social media's original promise made sense: show us what gets the most engagement, because that's what we want. Attention-based democracy.

And sometimes it works. That's why we keep coming back.

The thrill of discovering alpha before everyone else. The satisfaction of sharing something that makes your friends laugh. The warmth of a post that feels written just for you in that moment.&#x20;

But the bangers are buried under endless slop. Something is broken.

## We're being harvested

Every day we open social media expecting to see _what matters_. But it mostly shows _what makes us keep scrolling and clicking_. Rage/fear/lust bait. Brainrot. Misinformation.

Because most of Twitter/X's revenue still comes from advertising. Which means increasing **engagement activity** increases how much money they can make from ads. Content that provokes strong emotional reactions (especially negative) generates more engagement than deep, nuanced, helpful content.

But advertising revenue doesn't distinguish between "engaged because love" vs. "engaged because angry". For Twitter/X, when it comes to scrolls and clicks, number must go up.

In the attention economy, your focus is the raw material getting processed and sold to advertisers. Slop is just the most efficient way to keep us on the hook.

## Root cause of the sloppening

There's many reasons why social media platforms show so much slop on their main feeds. Ad revenue is tied to engagement metrics, emotionally charged content generates more engagement, slop is cheap to produce, verification is expensive, weak penalties for abusers.

But the root cause is simple:

**Engagement has no skin in the game.**

There's no cost for engaging with slop, so selfish interests boost slop. And there's no reward for engaging with bangers, so curators don't boost bangers. With these skewed incentives, platforms are forced to prioritize posts by activity (instead of conviction), because activity is all they can measure.

Feeds within group chats are better because they have status-based skin in the game. If you share slop, you're ignored. If you share bangers, you're celebrated. And you should be. When you share a tweet with someone, you're delivering value, so they don't have to dig around in the slop for it.

## We are what we scroll

"You are the average of the people you spend the most time with." But now we spend more time online than anywhere else. So we're becoming the average of the content we consume.

Bangers make us stronger: useful ideas to apply, uplifting stories to feel, beautiful art and jokes to enjoy... Slop drains our spirit. But algorithms can’t tell the difference, because the weights are tuned to stickiness, not growth.

Even if they wanted to show us bangers only (and lose ad revenue based on mass compulsion), they couldn't.

So maybe it's evil. But it's also bad game design. The way traditional social media platforms measure attention (engagement) is easy to manipulate. So no matter how good the algorithm is, slop proliferates.

## Why we're here

We're Twitter/X power users. Curators. We spend hours finding signal in the noise. And all we get for it is some local clout.

Meanwhile, slop merchants are farming engagement metrics and getting rich.

That sucks. So we're building something about it.

We launched a “tweetcoin” launchpad to test social media [curation markets](https://medium.com/@simondlr/introducing-curation-markets-trade-popularity-of-memes-information-with-code-70bf6fed9881) in their rawest form. The vision resonated (1k+ users, $3m+ volume, Colosseum accelerator), but the product wasn’t delightful enough: too complex, too easy to manipulate, and too PvP.

So we built a better game. Simpler. Harder to manipulate. More PVE. With one token where all value flows.

## Proof of Taste

What if the people who find bangers early actually got rewarded? What if taste was an asset, instead of a hobby?

With Bangit, content curation is a real game with real stakes. Bet on bangers, and win as they rise. Push slop, and you pay. Creators earn too when their posts gets upvoted.

The result: a feed where conviction matters more than activity. Where bangers rise because people commit to them. Where slop sinks because it's expensive to pretend it's good. And where the value captured flows to the best curators and creators—the people who make social media worth opening.

## The Homepage of Social Media

Everyday, millions of people are playing the game of finding bangers early and sharing them with friends. But, the gameplay is local, fragmented, and unrewarding.

Bangit is a global, unified, rewarding version of the most popular game in the world.

Taste finally pays.
