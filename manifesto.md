# ⭐ Manifesto

## The daily dose

Open Twitter/X. WTF _scroll_ DUMB _scroll_ EW _scroll..._ **BANG**_**.**_ Wow. I'm definitely gonna use that. I just evolved. _**30 minutes later.**_ Why am i still scrolling? What just happened? Screw this, i got stuff to do.

## They promised us bangers

Every day we open social media expecting to see _what matters_. But it mostly shows _what makes us keep scrolling and clicking_.

We're accepting a deal from social media platforms, which sounds pretty good: they show us what gets the most engagement, because that's what the people want. They can show us some ads, as long as it's free to use.

This is the attention economy.

And sometimes it works. That's why we keep coming back. For the joy of sharing something that makes our friends laugh. For the thrill of discovering alpha before everyone else. For the warmth of a post that feels like it was written just for us in that moment.

But the bangers are buried under endless slop. Rage/fear/lust-bait. Brainrot. Misinformation. What's up with that?

## Why slop wins

Platforms optimize for engagement (scrolls, clicks, time-spent). Because more engagement = more ad revenue.

But engagement metrics can't tell the difference between "engaged because I love this" vs. "engaged because this was so dumb it pissed me off". **A hate-click counts the same as a love-click.**

So content that provokes strong emotional reactions (especially negative) wins. Slop is also cheaper to produce. So emotional slop floods the feed. And as people engage, it spreads. From there, it's a race to the bottom.

Platforms _could_ optimize for satisfaction or long-term retention instead of session length. Some have tried. But those metrics conflict with short-term engagement, which drives ad revenue.

In the attention economy, our focus is the raw material getting processed and sold to advertisers. Slop is just the most efficient way to extract it.

## The root cause

Compare the Twitter feed to a group chat.

In a group chat, if you share slop, you get ignored or mocked. If you share a banger, you're celebrated. You actually risk part of your clout every time you share something, with a chance to earn more. There's social skin in the game.

But on Twitter, there's no cost for rage-clicking slop, and no reward for supporting a banger early. Accounts just scroll and click. While the algorithm aggregates it.

This is the root cause of the sloppening:

**Engagement has no skin in the game.**

Without stakes, platforms rank content by _activity_ (how many interactions) instead of _conviction_ (how strongly people actually endorse it). Activity is all they measure, so activity is all that matters. Enabling the proliferation of slop.

## We are what we scroll

"You are the average of the people you spend the most time with."

But now we spend more time online than anywhere else. So we're becoming the average of the content we consume.

Bangers make us stronger: useful ideas, uplifting stories, beautiful art, jokes that hit. Slop drains our spirit. But algorithms can’t tell the difference, because they're tuned for reactivity, not quality.

## Why we're here

We're power users. Curators. Explorers. We spend hours finding signal in the noise. Delivering it to people who trust our taste.

In college, I wrote a crypto newsletter. The most popular section, by far, was "Tweets of the Week": a curation of the best tweets I'd found while scrolling Crypto Twitter. People said it was the only reason they subscribed. Because they were saving time and energy. Getting the bangers without the slop.

But I couldn't figure out a good way to make it sustainable. Ads meant selling my readers' attention. Subscriptions meant charging for free content I simply organized better. Neither felt right.

That's when I realized: **Curation is valuable, but there's no good economic model for it.** People who find bangers early get nothing. The platform that serves the slop gets everything.

## Proof of Taste

What if the people who find bangers early actually got rewarded? What if taste was an asset, instead of just a hobby?

That's Bangit. A gamified curation market for Crypto Twitter.

How it works: Upvote bangers. Downvote slop. Your amount of staked BANG tokens determines your voting power. If others agree, you earn. If they don't, you lose.

Creators earn automatically too when their tweets get upvoted.

Bangit is positive-sum because it produces feeds ranked by conviction, not activity. Bangers rise because people commit to them. Slop sinks because it's expensive to pretend it's good. And the value created flows to the people who make social media worth it: the best curators and creators.

## The world if social media had skin in the game

We believe taste, the ability to recognize quality, is one of the most undervalued skills in the world.

Until now, it's been a passion project. Something we do for clout in group chats. While slop merchants farm engagement and get rich hacking people's attention.

Taste should be an asset.

Bangit is where the best curators and creators capture the value they create. Where your feed is ranked by **what people stand on**, not **what they clicked on**.

Millions of people around the world are already playing this game everyday. Finding bangers early and sharing them with friends. But, the gameplay is local, fragmented, and unrewarding.

Bangit makes the game of content curation global, unified, and worth playing.

Welcome to the homepage of social media. Where taste finally pays.
