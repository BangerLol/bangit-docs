# Manifesto

## **We are what we eat**

The thoughts, feelings, and actions that we observe influence us. "You are the average of the people you spend the most time with." But now we spend more time online than anywhere else. So we're becoming the average of the content we consume.

## Food groups

**Bangers make us stronger.** Good ideas to apply, uplifting stories to feel, beautiful art and jokes to enjoy. OMG, LOL, WOW. Learning, laughing, and capitalizing on opportunities.

**Slop makes us weaker.** Rage/fear bait, lukewarm opinions, ads. MEH, WUT, EW. Wasting our time, polluting our psyche, and selling us stuff we don't need.

## Why fast food dominates

We get most of our content from social media feeds. But these feeds serve mostly slop. Slop dominates because it's cheap to produce, short enough to trigger reactions, and easy to optimize for engagement.\
\
The root cause of the sloppening: **Engagement has no skin in the game.**\
\
There's no cost for engaging with slop, so selfish interests boost slop. And there's no reward for engaging with bangers early, so curators don't boost bangers. Even if social media companies wanted to show us bangers only, it's impossible with soft engagement metrics, because they're noisy signals without skin in the game.\
\
Feeds within group chats are better because they have status-based skin in the game via reactions. If you share slop, you're ignored. If you share bangers, you're celebrated.

## The secret ingredient

**What if engagement had financial skin in the game?** If it was costly to boost slop, and rewarding to boost bangers, then posts could be sorted by impact/value instead of engagement/activity. While the best curators and creators share in the value created.\
\
First, we tested this theory of skin-in-the-game-for-engagement with a tweetcoin launchpad, so that curators could trade tweets like memecoins on bonding curves. But, the experience was not delightful enough to be sticky. Pay-to-play friction, complex gameplay (portfolio management), and PvP.\
\
Bangit is free-to-play, with simple gameplay, and a more PvE experience to test the skin-in-the-game-for-engagement theory.&#x20;
