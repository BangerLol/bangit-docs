# 💎 Staking

#### Stake BANG for more rewards, clout, and influence on the feeds.

## Stake BANG to increase Max Power

* **More rewards:** more voting Power for more Curator Rewards + higher Reward Boost for more Creator and Inviter Rewards
* **More aesthetic clout:** higher Max Power Tier, displayed on profile
* **More influence on the feeds:** stronger effect on the ranking of tweets

A daily increasing Time Multiplier further increases Max Power and Reward Boost, which amplifies Creator and Inviter rewards.

**Max Power** = 100 + (Staked BANG \* Time Multiplier)

**Time Multiplier (Max 5)** = 1 + (0.01 × Days Staked)

**Reward Boost (Max 3)** = 1 + ((Max Power - 100) / 1000)

Unstaking BANG has a 1-10% burn fee, which decreases as Time Multiplier increases. Unstaking BANG decreases Max Power and Reward Boost immediately, while the unstaked tokens unlock gradually over 7 days.

Unstaking BANG does not affect Time Multiplier for the remaining staked BANG. When staking more BANG: **New Time Multiplier** = ((Old BANG Staked \* Old Time Multiplier) + Additional BANG Staked) / New BANG Staked
