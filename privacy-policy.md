# Privacy Policy

### A. Bangit Application And Website

This privacy policy applies to your use of the Bangit application, backend services, and website pages associated with Bangit (collectively, “Bangit”). In this privacy policy “we” or “us” refers to Banger Labs Inc, a Delaware corporation.

If you obtain the Bangit application through an app store, you should also be aware that app stores have their own data collection practices, and we encourage you to read their privacy policy as well.

### B. Privacy By Design

We have designed Bangit to minimize the impact on your privacy as a user, and we encourage you to read this privacy policy to understand what we do collect, how we use it, and your rights with respect to your personal information.

### C. Your Personal Information

We receive the following information that we consider to be "personal information":

1. Twitter/X account information (e.g., user ID, handle, and authentication tokens provided via OAuth)
2. IP addresses (and other device identifiers)
3. Cryptocurrency wallet address (embedded wallet via Privy)

We adopt a broad definition of personal information to account for potential correlations that could deanonymize data. Any information that could be used to identify an individual is treated as personal information.

We do not consider the pseudonymous public username or Twitter/X handle you use in Bangit as personal information _per se_. However, if you use identifiable information (e.g., your real name) in your username or profile, it may become personally identifiable and thus treated as personal information.

Additionally, if you contact our customer support team, participate in promotions, apply for roles with us, or otherwise share personal information not required to use Bangit, we may collect additional data you choose to disclose during those interactions or other personal information about you that you choose to disclose as part of that process.

### D. Why We Collect Personal Information

| **Personal Information**                | **Why Is It Collected?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Twitter/X account information           | To enable login and integration with Twitter/X via OAuth for accessing and curating tweets. This also allows us to associate your Bangit activities (e.g., upvotes) with your Twitter/X account for reward distribution. We may use this information to notify you about updates to this privacy policy, legal agreements, or critical app information. |
| IP Address And Other Device Identifiers | Internet connections to Bangit’s services automatically expose IP addresses and device metadata. This data is collected as part of standard internet communication protocols to ensure functionality, security, and performance of the app. Bangit uses IP addresses and device metadata for sybil preventions.                                         |
| Cryptocurrency Walllet Address          | To manage your embedded Solana wallet via Privy and facilitate BANG token transactions (e.g., staking, rewards distribution). This also ensures accurate delivery of rewards for curation, creation, and invite activities.                                                                                                                             |

Bangit is continuously improved, and we use personal information and other data to analyze user behavior and enhance app features such as upvote power mechanics and reward distribution.

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. However, we may share your embedded wallet address (without other personal data) with partners to facilitate reward distributions or other programs beneficial to you.

### E. Third-Party Integrations and Programs

Bangit integrates with third-party services such as Twitter/X and Privy for authentication and wallet management. When participating in Bangit’s ecosystem (e.g., receiving BANG token rewards), limited personal information may be shared with third-party service providers or partners. We only share data with entities that have contractually guaranteed confidentiality, and we do not provide your Twitter/X account details or other sensitive information unless necessary. These third parties may have their own terms and privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. By using Bangit, you consent to the transfer of necessary information to enable these integrations and services, which may involve data transfers to countries outside Bangit’s operational jurisdiction.

### F. What We Don’t Collect

As part of our privacy-by-design approach, we limit the personal information we collect. We do not collect:

1. Your full name (unless voluntarily provided)
2. Your phone number
3. Your date of birth
4. Your mailing address
5. Your tax identification or national identification number

### G. Cookies

Bangit uses cookies and similar technologies (e.g., local storage, session storage) to enhance user experience and track app performance. Marketing and analytics tools integrated into Bangit may also use these technologies.

### H. Data Storage

We store data, including personal information, in secure locations within the United States and other regions, using vendors that have contractually guaranteed data confidentiality. We implement access controls and technical safeguards to protect your personal information and our systems.

### I. Accuracy of Records

You may request access to the personal information we hold about you (“records”) by contacting us. We will require identity verification to ensure we are providing access to the correct individual.

If you identify inaccuracies in our data, you may request corrections. However, much of the data we collect (e.g., IP addresses, wallet addresses) is automatically generated and may not be editable.

### J. Deletion Of Records

If you choose to stop using Bangit, you may request the deletion of your records by contacting us. We may decline deletion requests if required by law, for business necessity, or due to anticipated future needs. We cannot delete data held by third parties (e.g., Twitter/X or Privy) on your behalf.

### K. Retention of Records

We generally retain personal information and business records indefinitely unless otherwise specified. However, we reserve the right to delete data at any time and encourage you to maintain your own copies of important information.

### M. Ownership of Tweet Content and Intellectual Property

Bangit does not claim ownership of any tweets, media, or other content created or shared on Twitter/X and rendered through the Bangit application. All intellectual property rights in the tweets and associated media remain with the original creator or rights holder, as governed by Twitter/X’s terms of service and applicable laws. Bangit’s use of tweet content is limited to displaying, curating, and distributing rewards based on user interactions within the app, as described in this privacy policy. We do not reproduce, modify, or distribute your tweet content beyond what is necessary to provide Bangit’s services or as permitted by Twitter/X’s API and terms.

### N. Compliance with Laws

Bangit Labs Inc complies with applicable laws and regulations. We may disclose personal information if required by legal processes in our operating jurisdictions or elsewhere.

### O. Sale of Our Business

In the event of a sale, merger, or other lawful transaction involving Bangit, your personal information may be transferred to the acquiring entity.

### P. Amending This Policy

We may update this privacy policy with at least 5 business days’ notice before changes take effect. Notices will be provided via the app, website, or other communication channels.
