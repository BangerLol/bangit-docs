# 🎁 Rewards

#### Rewards are distributed daily to top voters, authors, and inviters.

Everyday at midnight UTC, the Rewards Pool is distributed to voters, authors, and inviters based on performance in the last 24 hours. At the same time, the Jackpot has a 7% chance of also being distributed to top voters.

Users can claim rewards at anytime. "Claim + Stake" is free, while "Claim" has a 20% fee on the claimable tokens. A 10% fee on unclaimed rewards is applied every 24 hours they are left unclaimed.
