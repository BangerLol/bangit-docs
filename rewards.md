# Rewards

#### Rewards are distributed daily to curators, creators, and inviters.

Everyday at midnight UTC, new BANG tokens are minted to curators, creators, and inviters based on their performance in the last 24 hours. Bangit uses a proprietary algorithm to allocate rewards to contributors based on voting in the period. This algorithm is open source and governed by decision markets. Contributors can claim their rewards at anytime. 10% of unclaimed rewards are burned every 7 days they are left unclaimed.&#x20;
