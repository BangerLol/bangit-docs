# Rewards

#### Rewards are distributed daily to curators, creators, and inviters.

Every 24 hours at midnight UTC, new BANG tokens are minted and distributed based on activity in the last 24 hours. Claim your rewards at anytime. 10% of unclaimed rewards are burned every 7 days they are left unclaimed.

90% of new BANG tokens go to tweets (Tweet Rewards). For each tweet's reward, 80% goes to voters (Curator Rewards) and 20% goes to the tweet author (Creator Rewards).

10% of new BANG tokens go to inviters (Inviter Rewards).

## Methodology

Bangit uses a proprietary algorithm to allocate rewards to curators, creators, and inviters based on voting in the period. This algorithm is open source and governed by futarchy.
