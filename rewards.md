# Rewards

#### Daily rewards are distributed to curators, creators, and inviters.

Every 24 hours at midnight UTC, new BANG tokens are minted and distributed based on activity in the last 24 hours. Claim your rewards at anytime. 10% of unclaimed rewards are burned every 7 days they are left unclaimed.

90% of new BANG tokens go to tweets (Tweet Rewards). For each tweet's reward, 80% goes to voters (Curator Rewards) and 20% goes to the tweet author (Creator Rewards).

10% of new BANG tokens go to inviters (Inviter Rewards).

## Methodology

Bangit uses an algorithm to allocate rewards to tweets and curators + creators based on their performance in the period. Soon, this algorithm will be open-source and governed by futarchy.
