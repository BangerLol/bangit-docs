# ⚡ Power

## Voting requires power

Upvote or Downvote tweets using 1-20% of your Max Power per vote. Power regenerates at a rate of 100% per day, continuously. You can vote on the same tweet again after an 8-hour cooldown period.

## Vote on tweets to affect their Net Impact

Tweets are ranked in the Hot and Top feeds based on their Net Impact.

```
Net Impact = Upvote Impact - Downvote Impact
```

```
Upvote/Downvote Impact = (Power^0.7) * (Conviction^0.3)
```

## Stake BANG to increase Max Power

```
Max Power = 100 + (Staked BANG * Time Multiplier)
```
