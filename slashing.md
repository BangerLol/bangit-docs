# Slashing

#### Staked BANG is slashed (burned) daily.

## Curation Performance Penalty

Everyday at midnight UTC, voters' staked BANG is slashed (burned) based on performance in the last 24 hours. Each period, the bottom 50% of voters by net profit are slashed. The best voter of the bottom 50% is slashed by 1%. The worst voter is slashed by 10%. All other voters in the bottom 50% are slashed between 1-10%. The logic to slash voters is open source and governed by decision markets.

## Abuse Penalty

Bangit uses advanced network analysis to detect sybils, cartels, and farmer accounts. The logic to slash abusers is kept private to limit targeted abuse.
