# ⚔️ Slashing

#### Pushing slop has consequences.

Skin in the game means while good taste is rewarded, bad taste is punished.

## Curation Performance Penalty

Everyday at midnight UTC, voters' staked BANG is slashed (burned) based on performance in the last 24 hours. Each period, the bottom quarter (25%) of voters ranked by Motion lose 1-10% of their staked BANG. The worse your calls, the bigger the penalty.

## Abuse Penalty

Bangit uses analysis tools to detect and slash sybils, cartels, and farmer accounts periodically as needed.
